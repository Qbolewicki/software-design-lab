* design of design 1, 2, 3

----------Chapter 1


here we're concerned with systems design, not artistic design. they're both creative, but the end products are different

we're also concerned with original design, rather than following laid-out instructions or decision trees

three aspects of making:

1. conceptual construct
2. implementation
3. interactivity, real uses

we have the platonic ideal of a thing, then the implementation is an instantiation of the thing

design concepts should have conceptual integrity. a good design should delight
keeping a vision of the project as a unified whole makes individual decisions easier—do they fit the paradig of the design?

----------Chapter 2

rational model — kind of a straw man here, usually associated with figuring everything out and then doing it all. waterfall is a faous example of this
rational model seems great on paper and makes sense to admin types, but experienced designers almost never do things this way

desideratum

design is typically optimized toward a utility function

asymptotic utility — each window, or bit of spped, or whatever is slightly less valuable than the ones before

Constrains — limits on the shape of the project

resource allocation — liited resources are a specific kind of restraint that is present in every project

design tree


----------chapter 3

rational model seems like how it ought to work, but it doesn't really work that way

the hardest part of design is deciding what to design

iteration is constantly necessary based on interaction with the real world

iteration and rapid prototyping are now considered the way to do things, which includes helping clients figure out what they need

goal iteration

why we need to do iterative design:

1. We don't know the goal when we start
2. We don't know the full design tree but uncover it
3. The design tree is super complex with a lot of branches
4. We can't tell whether decisions will really fit until we try them
5. Requirements and constraints change
6. Designers just don't work that way

why do we still have the rational model around?

1. Novices like it
2. Bosses like it
