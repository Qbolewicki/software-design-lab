# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week Two (2/6 to 2/13)

This weeK I spent the majority of my time learning python basics and trying to remember how to upload files to the Git templates folder. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, trying to decipher my terminal session from class, but was somewhat successful. I think the lab hours are supposed to be added to the "journals" folder so I will attempt that again with this journal. I'm learning python though "How to Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw, a book ive heard recommended a few times. It is going well, I made it through chapter 1 in a couple hours last night.
