# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week ten (3/27 to 4/3)

This week regarding the final project,  Kelly started up an etherpad page where we copied Sabina's proposal and started generating questions to ask.  We took advise from the guest lecture a couple weeks ago when generating questions,  and tried to set up a skype interview with Sabina.  Unfortunately we were unable to reach her and ran out of time for the week.  We will try to reschedule a new time tomorrow so we can start sussing out tasks between us.   

Regarding lab hours,  I spent time this week working with R and ggplot in R creating a map that was more aesthetically pleasing. I spent probably an hour total on the prison project, doing some review on techniques and software we could use for it.  I gave Flask a try and got stuck with an error in the first chapter of "The Flask Mega-Tutorial".  Lastly,  I worked on Python for a couple hours,  reading and writing more files, as well as functions.
