# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week seven (3/6 to 3/13)

This week I spent time learning python.  I covered variables which I am happy to say made sense to me.  We introduced the "{}"  sequence and starting strings with the letter "f"  which also made sense to me.  I think I've got a grip on strings and variables,  but I had to google what "breaking code" meant and I'm having a hard time understanding how to break the code in the exersizes in "Learn python 3 the hard way".  Finally I got stuck on exersize 8 when I got the error:  "IndexError: tuple index out of range".  I didnt get to practive as much as I would have liked to this week becuase I got a little wrapped up in a take-home midterm for my geospatial humanities class.


Hour 1:  learning variables
Hour 2:  "f" strings and functions
Hour 3:  "
Hour 4:  "
Hour 5:  breaking code
Hour 6:  more complicated strings
