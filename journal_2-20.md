# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week Two (2/13 to 2/20)

This week I'm attempting again to upload my journal from command line.  Once I get the changes to be committed and try to push I get the error "Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists."  later when I tried "git push -u origin --all" I got the error "Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
Quinns-MacBook-Pro:journals qbolewicki$ git push -f --set-upstream origin master
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository."
I spent the remainder of my time working on python in VS Code and printing in command line.
