# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week eight (3/13 to 3/20)

This week I spent almost all fo my time learning Python.  I started the week by trying to fix the cafe app we worked on in class to make it run,  and realized I just needed to learn more python before I could tackle that.  I continued formatting strings from last week,  then started learning about escape sequences.  Finally and excitingly I started learning about prompts,  which had a big part in making the cafe app.  I got excited and tried to figure out the cafe app again but kept getting various errors,  and now re-writing this app has become one of my goals for the class.  I got stuck and spent an absurd amount of time trying to figure out the exersize 15 study drill in "Learn python3 the hard way",  where I had to print an argument variable in python through command line.
