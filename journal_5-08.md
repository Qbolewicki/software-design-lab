# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week 14 (5/01 to 5/08)

This week for the final project we wrote our "About us" pages.  Kelly worked on implimenting that text along with the syllibus,  and I created avatars for the group and edited the "Why DH" text.

For lab hours I spent approximately 15 hours working in R trying to get  images hosted on github to show up upon clicking the points on the map.  I added a satellite mini map,  and was able to create an  .html file that functions well in chrome and firefox.
