# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week eleven (4/3 to 4/10)

We made a lot of really great progress on the final project this week.  On Saturday,  Kelly and I were able to interview Sabina via Skype and get a clearer idea of her vision for the static site.  We took a lot of tips from the guest lecture when interviewing,  and they proved to be very helpful in the process.  Next, we began working out the tasks between Kelly and myself.  Kelly took on the role of UI design,  and I took on the role of UX. I spent the rest of my time on the project wireframing the website and making sure all of Sabina's needs were met.

As far as lab hours,  I spent most of my time in python learning more about functions.  I learned how functions and variables interact,  how to open files with functions,  and how to return stuff with functions.
