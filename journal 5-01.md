# Quinn's Technical Journal

## Week 13 (4/24 to 5/01)

This week for the final project Kelly wrote the html for the homepage of the static site,  and I created a prototype the   "connect"  page.  Sabina loved the prototype and we decided to move forward with adding the images to the  "connect"  page on the site. We also implimented the  "Why DH"  text.

As far as lab hours I spent several hours creating a map in R using leaflet getting images to pop up upon clicking a point.  The images are histed locally so the map can not be exported to html at the moment.  I got to chapter 21 of  "learn python the hard way".
